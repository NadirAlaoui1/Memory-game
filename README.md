# Memory-game
- To show what we've learned over the past few weeks, we were given the task to make a memory game. I approached this task by making a fully responsive card deck with HTML and Css.
  The part that still was difficult for me was writing JavaSript on my own, I used a tutorial which I fully understood after looking at the code a few times, but at the moment I wouldn't be able to write it from scratch.
  
## Features
- When you click on a card there is a small animation and the card turns around. The card doesn't turn around until you click on another one, if it is not a match the cards turn back around, if it is a match the card will stay shown.
- Everytime you refresh the cards randomly position on the page.



## To-do list

### Must-have features
- Explanation on the page itself

### Nice-to-have features
- Make it playable by keyboard
- Let a user define custom image urls
- Multiplayer (local)
- When player wins there is a message that pops up and player can play again.
